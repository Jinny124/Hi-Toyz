                finding the toys he wants to collect, and he has to search <br> many toy stores to find the toys he wants. It became an idea
                to build a rare and unique toy store. <br> Finally, his store was named HI-TOYZ as a symbol of happiness for the collectors. Currently,<br>
                Alex has established partnerships with several well-known toy collectors and HI-TOYZ has <br> become a center of activity for toy collectors.
